OpenCV_Bites
My first contact with the OpenCV library

For university I got the oportunity to do a little robotics project with Aldebarans NAO robot.

Its movements usually get programmed within a special development environment called choreographe, which mainly consists of preconfigured building blocks you simply have to choose, connect and update its parameters.

Our Idea was to let it play chess (or at least do a few moves) and for that purpose NAO would have to recognize, when its opponent would have made a move 

Usually the object recognition is also done inside choreographe, but since the robots where really old and worn out (which unfortunately sabotaged the whole project), object recognition did not work at all and I was forced  to think of another way for letting NAO know when a piece was moved. During my research I stumbled upon OpenCV and started to play around with it a little bit. Unfortunately I ran out of time to implement a real OpenCV object detection but at least I was able to implement a little program that signals NAO when a piece was moved on a certain field.

I dont have much time to play around besides my university studies and my job, but since I enjoyed it a lot, I absolutely see myself coming back to OpenCV to explore its possibilities. Also the OpenCV library is often used in ML/DL so I will get in contact with it naturally, when I dig deeper in that subject, which I really look forward to.
